# Collision Detection and Timing Features

## üö® Collision Detection System

The dynamic MAPF system now includes comprehensive collision detection to ensure path safety and provide real-time feedback.

### **Types of Collisions Detected:**

1. **Vertex Collisions**: Two agents occupy the same position at the same time
2. **Edge Collisions**: Two agents swap positions (cross paths) at the same time

### **When Collisions Are Checked:**

1. **After Replanning**: Every time paths are replanned (when adding new agents)
2. **During Simulation**: Every 10 timesteps during the simulation
3. **Manual Check**: Press 'C' key for immediate collision check

### **Collision Logging:**

When collisions are detected, you'll see console output like:
```
üö® COLLISION DETECTED! Found 2 collision(s):
   Vertex collision: Agents (0, 1) at position (10, 15) at timestep 25
   Edge collision: Agents (2, 3) swapping positions ((5, 5), (6, 6)) at timestep 30
```

Or during simulation:
```
üö® COLLISION AT TIMESTEP 45! Found 1 collision(s):
   Vertex collision: Agents (1, 4) at position (12, 18)
```

### **No Collision Message:**
```
‚úÖ No collisions detected - all paths are collision-free!
```

## ‚è∞ New Agent Timing Fix

### **Problem Solved:**
Previously, when you added new agents, they would start moving from the current timestep, which looked unnatural.

### **Solution:**
New agents now start from **timestep 0** and are properly synchronized with existing agents.

### **How It Works:**
1. When you add a new agent, the system calculates the current timestep
2. The new agent's path is padded with its start position for all previous timesteps
3. The agent appears to have been "waiting" at its start position until now
4. This creates a natural-looking entry into the simulation

### **Example:**
- Current timestep: 25
- You add a new agent at position (5, 5)
- The agent's path becomes: [(5,5), (5,5), ..., (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), ...]
- The agent appears to have been waiting at (5,5) for 25 timesteps, then starts moving

## üéÆ Enhanced Controls

### **New Keyboard Controls:**
- **C**: Manual collision check (prints current collision status to console)
- **R**: Replan all paths (also triggers collision check)
- **A**: Add new agent (with proper timing)
- **SPACE**: Pause/Resume simulation
- **LEFT/RIGHT ARROWS**: Step through timesteps
- **ESC**: Quit

### **Updated Instructions:**
The on-screen instructions now show: `SPACE: Pause/Play   ‚Üê/‚Üí: Step   ESC: Quit   A: Add Agent   R: Replan   C: Check Collisions`

## üîç How to Use Collision Detection

### **1. Automatic Detection:**
- Collisions are automatically checked after every replanning
- During simulation, collisions are checked every 10 timesteps
- Watch the console for collision messages

### **2. Manual Detection:**
- Press 'C' at any time to check for collisions
- Useful when you suspect there might be an issue
- Provides immediate feedback

### **3. Monitoring During Agent Addition:**
- When you add new agents, collision detection runs automatically
- You'll see either "‚úÖ No collisions detected" or detailed collision information
- This ensures your new agents don't create conflicts

## üéØ Benefits

### **Safety:**
- Real-time collision monitoring ensures path safety
- Immediate feedback if the pathfinding algorithm fails
- Helps identify potential issues in the MAPF solver

### **Debugging:**
- Detailed collision information helps understand what went wrong
- Timestep-specific collision detection helps pinpoint when issues occur
- Manual collision checking allows for on-demand verification

### **Natural Timing:**
- New agents enter the simulation naturally
- No more jarring "teleportation" of new agents
- Maintains visual consistency of the simulation

## üöÄ Example Usage

1. **Start the system:**
   ```bash
   ./run_dynamic.sh --with-initial
   ```

2. **Watch for collision messages** in the console as agents move

3. **Add a new agent** and observe:
   - Collision check runs automatically
   - New agent starts from timestep 0
   - Console shows collision status

4. **Press 'C'** to manually check for collisions at any time

5. **Monitor the simulation** for any collision warnings

## üîß Technical Details

### **Collision Detection Algorithm:**
- Compares all agent pairs at each timestep
- Checks both vertex and edge collisions
- Efficient implementation to avoid performance impact

### **Timing Adjustment:**
- Automatically detects when new agents are added
- Calculates proper padding for new agent paths
- Maintains synchronization with existing agents

### **Performance:**
- Collision checking every 10 timesteps to balance safety and performance
- Manual collision checks available on demand
- Efficient algorithms to handle large numbers of agents
